# PyOCR

## About

The GUI is supported with python tkinter. The OCR part is handled by

a wrapper for 
[Googleâ€™s Tesseract-OCR Engine](https://github.com/tesseract-ocr/tesseract). 
This tool also provide a manual correction 
(provided by [python-datamuse](https://pypi.org/project/python-datamuse/)) 
using homophones of target words.
